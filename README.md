# Sim Rt

Simple Ray tracing framework ***Sim Rt*** is based on the mini-book series of ***Peter Shirley*** that can be found on his [github](https://github.com/petershirley). It's a hobby project to learn about the basics of CPU Ray tracing and modern C++17.

## Topics

This sections covers algorithms and techniques that might be implemented in the future.

- **BRDF** - to model the reflectance properties of a material
- **PBR** - uses the BRDF, found [here](https://learnopengl.com/PBR/Theory)
- **Photon Mapping** - to get those nice caustics
- **Acceleration Structures** - to step away from a trivial implementation
  - **BVH**
- **Monte Carlo Integration** - found in the [pbr-book](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Monte_Carlo_Integration.html)
